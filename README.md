# The Official Awery Repository
This repository contains a collection of useful extensions that complement Awery's functionality.
## What's there?
At the moment there is only one extension for reading comments from Dantotsu.
## How to use it?
No way. At the moment, Avery does not know how to download extensions from repositories. If you want to download something, then come to our discord server.
